Question 1: Were there any warnings loading data into the JOBS table? What can be done to resolve this?
A: In column 2, we only define varchar with 15 characters, it is not enough for the data file to load into
Solved by, create that table again with 50 characters.

Question 2: Did all rows from the source file load successfully in the DEPARTMENT table? If not, are you able to figure out why not?
A: Primary key have a duplicate value. This table have primary key is DEPT_ID_DEP
